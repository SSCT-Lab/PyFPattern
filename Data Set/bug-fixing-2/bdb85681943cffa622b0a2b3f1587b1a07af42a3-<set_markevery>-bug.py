When using float arguments to set the markevery property\n        on irregularly spaced data, the markers will likely not appear evenly\n        spaced because the actual data points do not coincide with the\n        theoretical spacing between markers.\n\n        When using a start offset to specify the first marker, the offset will\n        be from the first data point which may be different from the first\n        the visible data point if the plot is zoomed in.\n\n        If zooming in on a plot when using float arguments then the actual\n        data points that have markers will change because the distance between\n        markers is always determined from the display-coordinates\n        axes-bounding-box-diagonal regardless of the actual axes data limits.\n\n        '
