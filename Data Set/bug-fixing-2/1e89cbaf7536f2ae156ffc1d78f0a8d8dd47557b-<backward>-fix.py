    'Runs error backpropagation (a.k.a.\\  backprop) from this variable.\n\n        On backprop,\n        :meth:`FunctionNode.backward() <chainer.FunctionNode.backward>`\n        is called on each :class:`~chainer.FunctionNode` object appearing in\n        the backward graph starting from this variable.\n        The backward graph is represented by backward\n        references from variable nodes to their creators, and from function\n        nodes to their input variable nodes. The backprop stops at all root\n        nodes. Some function nodes set ``None`` as gradients of some inputs,\n        where further backprop does not take place at such inputs.\n\n        This method uses :data:`grad` as the initial error array. User can\n        manually set a gradient array before calling this method. If\n        :data:`data` contains only one element (i.e., it is scalar) and\n        :data:`grad` is ``None``, then this method automatically complements\n        1.0 as the initial error. This is useful on starting backprop from\n        some scalar loss value.\n\n        From v3, this method supports *differentiable backprop* (a.k.a. double\n        backprop, grad of grads). To enable it, pass\n        ``enable_double_backprop=True``.\n\n        Args:\n            retain_grad (bool): If ``True``, the gradient arrays of all\n                intermediate variables are kept.\n                Otherwise, :data:`~chainer.Variable.grad` of the\n                intermediate variables are set to ``None`` on appropriate\n                timing, which may reduce the maximum memory consumption.\n\n                In most cases of training some models, the purpose of backprop\n                is to compute gradients of parameters, not of all variables,\n                and therefore it is recommended to set this flag ``False``.\n            enable_double_backprop (bool): *(Added in v3.0)* If ``True``,\n                computational trace of the whole backpropagation procedure is\n                recorded to the computational graph so that one can further do\n                backpropagation from the resulting gradients. Note that\n                enabling it results in larger memory consumption needed to\n                store the gradients w.r.t intermediate variables that are\n                required for the second gradient computation.\n\n        '
