    "Upsamples the input to either the given :attr:`size` or the given\n    :attr:`scale_factor`\n\n    .. warning::\n        This function is deprecated in favor of :func:`torch.nn.functional.interpolate`.\n        This is equivalent with ``nn.functional.interpolate(...)``.\n\n    .. include:: cuda_deterministic_backward.rst\n\n    The algorithm used for upsampling is determined by :attr:`mode`.\n\n    Currently temporal, spatial and volumetric upsampling are supported, i.e.\n    expected inputs are 3-D, 4-D or 5-D in shape.\n\n    The input dimensions are interpreted in the form:\n    `mini-batch x channels x [optional depth] x [optional height] x width`.\n\n    The modes available for upsampling are: `nearest`, `linear` (3D-only),\n    `bilinear`, `bicubic` (4D-only), `trilinear` (5D-only)\n\n    Args:\n        input (Tensor): the input tensor\n        size (int or Tuple[int] or Tuple[int, int] or Tuple[int, int, int]):\n            output spatial size.\n        scale_factor (float or Tuple[float]): multiplier for spatial size. Has to be an integer.\n        mode (string): algorithm used for upsampling:\n            ``'nearest'`` | ``'linear'`` | ``'bilinear'`` | ``'bicubic'`` |\n            ``'trilinear'``. Default: ``'nearest'``\n        align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the\n            input and output as squares rather than points.\n            If set to ``False``, the input and output tensors are aligned by the\n            center points of their corner pixels. If set to ``True``, the input and\n            output tensors are aligned by the corner points of their corner\n            pixels, and the interpolation uses edge value padding for out-of-boundary values.\n            This only has effect when :attr:`mode` is ``'linear'``,\n            ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'`` or ``'trilinear'``.\n            Default: ``False``\n\n    .. note::\n        With ``mode='bicubic'``, it's possible to cause overshoot, in other words it can produce\n        negative values or values greater than 255 for images.\n        Explicitly call ``result.clamp(min=0, max=255)`` if you want to reduce the overshoot\n        when displaying the image.\n\n    .. warning::\n        With ``align_corners = True``, the linearly interpolating modes\n        (`linear`, `bilinear`, and `trilinear`) don't proportionally align the\n        output and input pixels, and thus the output values can depend on the\n        input size. This was the default behavior for these modes up to version\n        0.3.1. Since then, the default behavior is ``align_corners = False``.\n        See :class:`~torch.nn.Upsample` for concrete examples on how this\n        affects the outputs.\n\n    "
