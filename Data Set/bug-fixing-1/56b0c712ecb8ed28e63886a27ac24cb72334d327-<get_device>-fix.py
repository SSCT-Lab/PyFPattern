    'Gets the device from a device object, an ID integer or an array object.\n\n    .. note::\n\n        This API is deprecated. Please use\n        :func:`~chainer.cuda.get_device_from_id`\n        or :func:`~chainer.cuda.get_device_from_array` instead.\n\n    This is a convenient utility to select a correct device if the type of\n    ``arg`` is unknown (i.e., one can use this function on arrays that may be\n    on CPU or GPU). The returned device object supports the context management\n    protocol of Python for the *with* statement.\n\n    Args:\n        args: Values to specify a GPU device. The first device object, integer\n            or :class:`cupy.ndarray` object is used to select a device.\n            If it is a device object, it is returned. If it is an integer,\n            the corresponding device is returned. If it is a CuPy array,\n            the device on which this array reside is returned. If any\n            arguments are neither integers nor CuPy arrays, a dummy device\n            object representing CPU is returned.\n\n    Returns:\n        Device object specified by given ``args``.\n\n    .. seealso::\n       See :class:`cupy.cuda.Device` for the device selection not by arrays.\n\n    '
