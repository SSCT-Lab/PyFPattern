    "Generate a single randomly distorted bounding box for an image.\n\n  Bounding box annotations are often supplied in addition to ground-truth labels\n  in image recognition or object localization tasks. A common technique for\n  training such a system is to randomly distort an image while preserving\n  its content, i.e. *data augmentation*. This Op outputs a randomly distorted\n  localization of an object, i.e. bounding box, given an `image_size`,\n  `bounding_boxes` and a series of constraints.\n\n  The output of this Op is a single bounding box that may be used to crop the\n  original image. The output is returned as 3 tensors: `begin`, `size` and\n  `bboxes`. The first 2 tensors can be fed directly into `tf.slice` to crop the\n  image. The latter may be supplied to `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` to\n  visualize\n  what the bounding box looks like.\n\n  Bounding boxes are supplied and returned as `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]`.\n  The\n  bounding box coordinates are floats in `[0.0, 1.0]` relative to the width and\n  height of the underlying image.\n\n  For example,\n\n  ```python\n      # Generate a single distorted bounding box.\n      begin, size, bbox_for_draw = tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box(\n          tf.shape(image),\n          bounding_boxes=bounding_boxes,\n          min_object_covered=0.1)\n\n      # Draw the bounding box in an image summary.\n      image_with_box = tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes(tf.expand_dims(image, 0),\n                                                    bbox_for_draw)\n      tf.summary.image('images_with_box', image_with_box)\n\n      # Employ the bounding box to distort the image.\n      distorted_image = tf.slice(image, begin, size)\n  ```\n\n  Note that if no bounding box information is available, setting\n  `use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes = true` will assume there is a single implicit\n  bounding box covering the whole image. If `use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes` is\n  false and no bounding boxes are supplied, an error is raised.\n\n  Args:\n    image_size: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `int8`,\n      `int16`, `int32`, `int64`.\n      1-D, containing `[height, width, channels]`.\n    bounding_boxes: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.\n      3-D with shape `[batch, N, 4]` describing the N bounding boxes\n      associated with the image.\n    seed: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.\n      If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to non-zero, the random number\n      generator is seeded by the given `seed`.  Otherwise, it is seeded by a\n        random\n      seed.\n    seed2: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.\n      A second seed to avoid seed collision.\n    min_object_covered: A Tensor of type `float32`. Defaults to `0.1`.\n      The cropped area of the image must contain at least this\n      fraction of any bounding box supplied. The value of this parameter should\n        be\n      non-negative. In the case of 0, the cropped area does not need to overlap\n      any of the bounding boxes supplied.\n    aspect_ratio_range: An optional list of `floats`. Defaults to `[0.75,\n      1.33]`.\n      The cropped area of the image must have an aspect ratio =\n      width / height within this range.\n    area_range: An optional list of `floats`. Defaults to `[0.05, 1]`.\n      The cropped area of the image must contain a fraction of the\n      supplied image within in this range.\n    max_attempts: An optional `int`. Defaults to `100`.\n      Number of attempts at generating a cropped region of the image\n      of the specified constraints. After `max_attempts` failures, return the\n        entire\n      image.\n    use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.\n      Controls behavior if no bounding boxes supplied.\n      If true, assume an implicit bounding box covering the whole input. If\n        false,\n      raise an error.\n    name: A name for the operation (optional).\n\n  Returns:\n    A tuple of `Tensor` objects (begin, size, bboxes).\n\n    begin: A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `image_size`. 1-D, containing\n    `[offset_height, offset_width, 0]`. Provide as input to\n      `tf.slice`.\n    size: A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `image_size`. 1-D, containing\n    `[target_height, target_width, -1]`. Provide as input to\n      `tf.slice`.\n    bboxes: A `Tensor` of type `float32`. 3-D with shape `[1, 1, 4]` containing\n    the distorted bounding box.\n      Provide as input to `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes`.\n  "
