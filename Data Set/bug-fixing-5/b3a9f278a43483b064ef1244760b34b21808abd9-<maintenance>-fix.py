def maintenance(self, deadline):
    '\n        Identify timelines that appear to be stuck in the ready state.\n\n        This method moves all timelines that are in the ready state back to the\n        waiting state if their schedule time is prior to the deadline. (This\n        does not reschdule any tasks directly, and should generally be\n        performed as part of the scheduler task, before the ``schedule``\n        call.)\n\n        This is designed to handle the situation where task execution is\n        managed by a separate system such as RabbitMQ & Celery from scheduling.\n        A digest task may not be able to be successfully retried after a failure\n        (e.g. if the process executing the task can no longer communicate with\n        the messaging broker) which can result in a task remaining in the ready\n        state without an execution plan.\n\n        This may cause issues when asynchronously processing timelines and\n        there is a severe backlog of timelines to be digested. Timelines in the\n        "ready" state that were scheduled for execution prior to the deadline\n        may still have outstanding tasks associated with them -- remember that\n        without the ability to interrogate the queue, we are unable to identify\n        if these tasks have finished but were unable to be removed from the\n        schedule, failed outright, or are still pending. As part of\n        maintenance, those timelines are moved back to the "waiting" state for\n        rescheduling, and if a pending task for a timeline that was previously\n        in the "ready" state but is now back in the "waiting" state actually\n        executes, it will fail to be executed. The timeline will later be moved\n        back to the "ready" state and rescheduled -- so it\'s contents will\n        eventually be processed -- but this may be significantly delayed from\n        the originally scheduled time. Both the queue backlog as well as the\n        frequency of the digest task raising an exception when a timeline is in\n        an invalid state should be monitored. If these exceptions happen\n        frequently -- especially during periods of abnormal queue growth -- the\n        frequency of maintenance tasks should be decreased, or the deadline\n        should be pushed further towards the past (execution grace period\n        increased) or both.\n        '
