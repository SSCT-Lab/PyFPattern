    'Fits the model on data generated batch-by-batch by a Python generator.\n\n        The generator is run in parallel to the model, for efficiency.\n        For instance, this allows you to do real-time data augmentation\n        on images on CPU in parallel to training your model on GPU.\n\n        # Arguments\n            generator: A generator.\n                The output of the generator must be either\n                - a tuple (inputs, targets)\n                - a tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights).\n                All arrays should contain the same number of samples.\n                The generator is expected to loop over its data\n                indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `steps_per_epoch`\n                batches have been seen by the model.\n            steps_per_epoch: Total number of steps (batches of samples)\n                to yield from `generator` before declaring one epoch\n                finished and starting the next epoch. It should typically\n                be equal to the number of samples of your dataset\n                divided by the batch size.\n                Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use\n                the `len(generator)` as a number of steps.\n            epochs: Integer, total number of iterations on the data.\n                Note that in conjunction with initial_epoch, the parameter\n                epochs is to be understood as "final epoch". The model is\n                not trained for n steps given by epochs, but until the\n                epoch of index `epochs` is reached.\n            verbose: Verbosity mode, 0, 1, or 2.\n            callbacks: List of callbacks to be called during training.\n            validation_data: This can be either\n                - A generator for the validation data\n                - A tuple (inputs, targets)\n                - A tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights).\n            validation_steps: Only relevant if `validation_data`\n                is a generator.\n                Number of steps to yield from validation generator\n                at the end of every epoch. It should typically\n                be equal to the number of samples of your\n                validation dataset divided by the batch size.\n                Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use\n                the `len(validation_data)` as a number of steps.\n            class_weight: Dictionary mapping class indices to a weight\n                for the class.\n            max_queue_size: Maximum size for the generator queue\n            workers: Maximum number of processes to spin up\n            use_multiprocessing: if True, use process based threading.\n                Note that because\n                this implementation relies on multiprocessing,\n                you should not pass\n                non picklable arguments to the generator\n                as they can\'t be passed\n                easily to children processes.\n            shuffle: Whether to shuffle the order of the batches at\n                the beginning of each epoch. Only used with instances\n                of `Sequence` (keras.utils.Sequence).\n            initial_epoch: Epoch at which to start training\n                (useful for resuming a previous training run).\n\n        # Returns\n            A `History` object.\n\n        # Raises\n            RuntimeError: if the model was never compiled.\n\n        # Example\n\n        ```python\n            def generate_arrays_from_file(path):\n                while 1:\n                    with open(path) as f:\n                        for line in f:\n                            # create Numpy arrays of input data\n                            # and labels, from each line in the file\n                            x, y = process_line(line)\n                            yield (x, y)\n\n            model.fit_generator(generate_arrays_from_file(\'/my_file.txt\'),\n                                steps_per_epoch=1000, epochs=10)\n        ```\n        '
