Assume the\n    interest rate is 5% (annually) compounded monthly.\n\n    >>> np.pv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)\n    -100.00067131625819\n\n    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out\n    (i.e., money not available today).  Thus, to end up with\n    $15,692.93 in 10 years saving $100 a month at 5% annual\n    interest, one\'s initial deposit should also be $100.\n\n    If any input is array_like, ``pv`` returns an array of equal shape.\n    Let\'s compare different interest rates in the example above:\n\n    >>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.04, 0.03))/12\n    >>> np.pv(a, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)\n    array([ -100.00067132,  -649.26771385, -1273.78633713]) # may vary\n\n    So, to end up with the same $15692.93 under the same $100 per month\n    "savings plan," for annual interest rates of 4% and 3%, one would\n    need initial investments of $649.27 and $1273.79, respectively.\n\n    '
